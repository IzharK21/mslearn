Here are four unit tests for the `absolute_square` function:

1. Test that the function returns 0 when both input numbers are the same
```
assert absolute_square(5, 5) == 0
```

2. Test that the function returns a positive value when the first input number is greater than the second
```
assert absolute_square(8, 5) == 9
```

3. Test that the function returns a positive value when the second input number is greater than the first
```
assert absolute_square(3, 6) == 9
```

4. Test that the function returns the correct value when both input numbers are negative
```
assert absolute_square(-5, -8) == 9
```
